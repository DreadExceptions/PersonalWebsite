	<!-- An About Blurb -->
	<p>This is the website of a random dude who goes by various aliases over the internet, 
	such as DrDreadnought, MarquisDreadnought, and DreadExceptions. 
	Apparently, he's got a thing about dread. Probably something he thought 
	was cool in middle school, but now it's lame. He's done various things, 
	such as writing poems, short stories, and programming. He's even tried 
	his hand at architecture. Everything he wishes to share can be found 
	on this website.</p>
	
	<p>There are two versions of this website, one that is fancy and one that is simple, 
	for slower internet. You can change the settings below.</p>
	<!-- Buttons for Thin/Fancy versions, Fancy is default -->
